A proof of concept repository to use the same style of scraping approach as [alltheplaces.xyz](https://alltheplaces.xyz/); in the Product domain.

The intended result is a dataset compatible with [Open Prices](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/open-prices) and or [ONDC](https://ondc.org/) services.

Borrows liberally from the codebase of https://alltheplaces.xyz/


# Roadmap

- [ ] Schema.org Product/Offer spider, based on the structureddataspider
